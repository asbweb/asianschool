  "subtitle": "The School places great emphasis on the values of wearing the correct uniform and dressing appropriately. Wearing a uniform is a badge of pride, creates an identity for the school and is an important part of being a school student. A school uniform teaches students to dress smartly and take pride in their appearance. A uniform diminishes economic and social barriers between students and helps keep students focused on their education, not their clothes. The school has authorized <strong>M/s Uniform City</strong> and <strong>M/s Master Uniforms </strong> to supply The Asian School uniforms in the Kingdom of Bahrain.",
