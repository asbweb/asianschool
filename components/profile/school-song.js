        Lead, Kindly Light,

        Amid th’encircling gloom,
        <br />
        Lead Thou me on!
        <br />
        The night is dark,
        <br />
        And I am far from home;
        <br />
        Lead Thou me on!
        <br />
        Keep Thou my feet;
        <br />
        I do not ask to see, the distant scene;
        <br />
        One step enough for me.
        <br />
        I was not e-ver thus,
        <br />
        Nor prayed that Thou
        <br />
        Shouldst lead me on;
        <br />
        I loved to choose, and see my path;
        <br />
        But now lead Thou me on!
        <br />
        I loved the garish day,
        <br />
        And, spite of fears, pride ruled my will.
        <br />
        Remember not past years!
        <br />
        Lead, Kindly Light,
        <br />
        Amid th’encircling gloom,
        <br />
        Lead Thou me on!
        <br />
