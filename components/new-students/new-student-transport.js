            Transport is provided in Air Conditioned buses to staff and students
            covering most parts of Bahrain. Transportation of students is not an
            obligatory service from the school, it has been arranged through
            external agencies for the convenience of parents. However, the
            school does have a transport department which, along with
            representatives of the contract agency, oversees and manages all
            aspects related to transport such as routes, stops, timings,
            allocations, availability of vehicles, breakdowns and safety.
          </p>
          <h5>TRANSPORT GUIDELINES</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A separate prescribed application form has to be submitted for
              availing the transport facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bus Nos., routes, pick-up and drop off points will be determined
              by the school at the beginning of each academic year and parents
              can choose the most suitable stop for their child.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change in bus nos., routes, stops and timing may be made during
              the year for reasons beyond the control of the school authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students may be moved to different buses during the academic year
              to maintain bus capacities. However, the bus stop opted for by the
              parent will remain unchanged.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separate badges should be obtained by children traveling by bus
              and it is compulsory to wear these badges on all school days.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any misbehaviour in the bus will lead to forfeiture of the
              transport facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the parent of a student who avails school transport wishes to
              pick up their child early, then they should do so before 12:30
              p.m. and only after intimating the school authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case a parent is not present at the bus-stop to collect the
              child, the child will be brought back to the school unless
              otherwise advised by the parent before-hand. These children should
              then be collected by the parent from the school.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change of bus stop for children can be made by the parent only
              with the approval of the school authorities, and for this a
              written application has to be submitted. Such changes will be
              approved only if there are available seats in the bus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parents withdrawing their children from availing the transport
              facility will need to inform the school in writing at least one
              month in advance. In the absence of such an application, transport
              fee will be charged.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students going on holiday will have to pay the transport fee along
              with the tuition fee for the period of leave.
            </li>
            <li>
              The school authorities are not responsible for any delay, accident
              or break-down of the transport buses. Parents availing transport
              facilities are doing so at their own risk.
