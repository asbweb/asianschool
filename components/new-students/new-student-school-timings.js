          The class hours are from 7:40 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
          <br className="mb-2" />
          Parents dropping their children to school are requested to do so
          before 7:30 a.m. The school gates will be closed at 7:35 a.m. and late
          comers will not be permitted to attend their classes for the day.
          <br className="mb-2"/>
          Parents are informed to not drop their children to school before 7:00
          a.m. and to pick up their children strictly before 2:00 p.m. Beyond
          these timings, the school will not be responsible for children.
          <br className="mb-2"/>
          As a precautionary measure of safety and to avoid confusion and chaos,
          children collected by their parents/guardians will not be sent out of
          their classrooms until buses leave the school premises.
          <br className="mb-2"/>
          Parents who prefer their children to commute by themselves have to
          complete two copies of the “Unescorted Student’s Travel Permission
          Form” in the School Diary and one copy must be submitted to the
          school.
